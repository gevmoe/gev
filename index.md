## Hello there

(note this page is just temporary until i make a custom one)
My name is ELMehdi Felaouss, im a developer, designer, geek, otaku... i like to test stuff and learn new things, i started my journey in this digital world when i was 7, but didnt really start to actually understand it until i became 10, i know many thing from design, programming video editing, digital art making and much more, but my passion is for websites.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Projects

right now i have 1 project which is a free discord host called [YumeNodes](https://yumenodes.net).
also since i liked an open source panel called [Dashactyl](https://github.com/real2two/dashactyl) i made this wiki [Dashactyl.wiki](https://www.dashactyl.wiki)
and im currently working on coding discord.tf which is slowing me from making a custom template for here and using a github pages theme but its okay.

I also do domain trading and selling i own a few of my own some are listed for sale and some are not, all can be found here [Felaouss](https://felaouss.net).
